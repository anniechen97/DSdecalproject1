###### [Annie Chen]
* I am currently a junior majored in Statistics and Economics at UC Berkeley. I've been involved in a professional club called Cal Actuarial League for over two years now. This semester as the Director of Case Competition Department, we will be holding an Actuarial Case Competition that help our members to develop and practice their technical skills and conceptual knowledge. I've also participated in the Golden Bear Orientation as the Leader of a transfer student group. This experience allows me to improve my interpersonal skills and time management skill.
* Jobs interested in: [Actuarial Analyst, Underwriter, Data Analyst]

###### [Catherine Sun]
* I am currently a sophomore studying intended data science. I hope to learn more about machine learning and sentiment analysis in the near future because I think that these topics are very uniquely interesting and practical for the modern world. My favorite hobbies are drawing (specifically with pen), playing piano, and swimming. My favorite foods are popcorn and sushi. Hopefully Iâ€™ll be able to meet many people this semester in this decal and learn various new data science skills. 
* Jobs interested in: [Data Analyst, Sentiment Analyst, Actuary]

###### [Uzumaki Naruto - Dana Shan]
* I am currently the Hokage of my Village and a dad to my son and daughter. I lost my parents at a young age and I did not have a very pleasant childhood. However, as i grew up, I made many friends in my village and met many people who I look up to. I never thought one day I would save the world with my "friend" sasuke, but I knew that I was gonna become the Hokage from day 1. While I am very grateful, I hope the next generation will be stronger than mine. 
* Jobs interested in: [New Sannin, Seventh Hokage, Sth rank Ninja]

###### [Harry Potter- Mengfan Zhang]
*I am currently a father of three children. I practice magic for pass time. Back in 1991, I attended the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at the age of eleven. And I soon became the youngest Quidditch player in a Century. My proudest achievement have been freeing an enslaved snake. Luckily, I have found quite a couple opportunites after my retirement to help more unfortunate animals. 
* Jobs interested in: [Animal Protector, Community Leader, Parseltongue Professor]
