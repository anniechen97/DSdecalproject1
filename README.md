* I am currently a junior majored in Statistics and Economics at UC Berkeley. I've been involved in a professional club called Cal Actuarial League for over two years now. This semester as the Director of Case Competition Department, we will be holding an Actuarial Case Competition that help our members to develop and practice their technical skills and conceptual knowledge.

* I am currently a sophomore studying intended data science. I hope to learn more about machine learning and sentiment analysis in the near future because I think that these topics are very uniquely interesting and practical for the modern world. My favorite hobbies are drawing (specifically with pen), playing piano, and swimming. My favorite foods are popcorn and sushi. Hopefully Iâ€™ll be able to meet many people this semester in this decal and learn various new data science skills.

###### [Uzumaki Naruto - Dana Shan]
* I am currently the Hokage of my Village and a dad to my son and daughter. I lost my parents at a young age and I did not have a very pleasant childhood. However, as i grew up, I made many friends in my village and met many people who I look up to. I never thought one day I would save the world with my "friend" sasuke, but I knew that I was gonna become the Hokage from day 1. While I am very grateful, I hope the next generation will be stronger than mine.
